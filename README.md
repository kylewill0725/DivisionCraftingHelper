The Division Crafting Helper is a program written in Autohotkey that sends keyboard commands to The Divsion in order to automatically upgrade your materials to High End. So take a break, and let this program upgrade those materials.

Current features include:
  - Support for all crafting materials
  - Estimated time required
  - Confirmation box
  - Text boxes automatically count down while crafting
  - Current status on the bottom of window

**Note: This is still in developement.** If it takes away items that it was not supposed to, submit a ticket containing the number of each material you were crafting (as close to exact as possible) and I will attempt to fix it as soon as possible.

To start, go to the crafting station and navigate to the Material Conversion tab (the last one).

Next, open the program and fill in the text boxes with the related materials. There are tabs above the textboxes in order to change between High End (Gold), Rare (Blue), and Division Tech (DZ).

Finally, ensure that The Division looks like the first picture, such that the High End Weapon Parts are selected (as shown by the extended bar). With that done, you are ready to press "Craft". A dialog will appear confirming your choices and showing you the number of materials to be crafted. Below the materials is the aproxamate time taken to finish crafting.

Assuming this is correct, press ok and reselect The Division's window. After three seconds, the program will start crafting.
